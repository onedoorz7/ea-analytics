            <h2>The Unconventional Path</h2>
            <p>I'm what you might call a "late bloomer" — and I've learned that's actually an advantage.</p>
            
            <p>Before analytics, I worked in film production, coached football, and did youth work. I come from a creative household, and I've always been drawn to understanding how things work — systems, people, stories, data.</p>
            
            <p>That background taught me something critical: <strong>the best insights come from connecting dots across domains</strong>, not just drilling deeper into one.</p>

            <h2>From Startup to IPO</h2>
            <p>I joined Riskified's New York office as a data analyst when it was still a growing startup. I worked closely with customer-facing teams and got to experience American business culture firsthand.</p>
            
            <p>Back in Israel, I became a product analyst — the "data guy" for a squad (a startup within the company). I defined how data was saved, transformed, and used. I built dashboards, defined KPIs, and ran analyses that shaped product decisions.</p>
            
            <p>Later, I became an internal "freelancer" — tackling strategic initiatives across the business. That role taught me I could deliver key insights in new domains, fast.</p>
            
            <p>I stayed through the IPO, learning what it takes to scale data infrastructure and decision-making from 50 people to 500+.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>"I realized I have what it takes to deliver key insights within new domains and relatively short timeframes — that's the generalist's advantage."</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why EA Analytics</h2>
            <p>After getting my MBA from Tel Aviv University (including a semester at Copenhagen Business School), I knew what I wanted to build: <strong>a consulting practice that brings enterprise-level analytics thinking to startups that can't afford a full-time team.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Most small-to-medium startups (under 50 people) don't have a dedicated analytics function. They're flying blind on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which leads are worth chasing (and which are burning money)</li>
                <li>What their ideal customer profile actually looks like</li>
                <li>Where deals are getting stuck in the sales funnel</li>
                <li>Which marketing channels are working (and which are vanity metrics)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>That's where I come in. I help you turn messy data into clear decisions — fast.</p>

            <h2>How I Work</h2>
            <p>I'm not here to sell you a six-month engagement and disappear. I take a <strong>proof-of-concept approach</strong>: we start with a focused analysis (often free for the right fit), you see the value, and we decide together what comes next.</p>
            
            <p>My philosophy is simple:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Depth over speed.</strong> Fast answers are useless if they're wrong.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentic relationships over volume.</strong> I work with clients I believe in.</li>
                <li><strong>Concrete outcomes over buzzwords.</strong> No "data-driven transformation journeys" — just clear insights and action plans.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Beyond Consulting</h2>
            <p>I'm also a beginner angel investor through CoreAngels, which means I'm constantly learning what early-stage founders need (and don't need) from their data.</p>
            
            <p>My content on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisha-amir/" target="_blank" style="color: #002366;">LinkedIn</a> reflects my belief in long-form, authentic storytelling — I share lessons learned, mistakes made, and frameworks that work.</p>

            <h2>Let's Talk</h2>
            <p>If you're a startup or small business trying to make better decisions with your data, let's have a conversation. No pitch, no pressure — just a real discussion about where you are and where you're trying to go.</p>
